# BandoriStation Mobile

## What's This App?
This is a Multiplatform client app targeting Android, iOS, Desktop, designed for [BandoriStation](https://github.com/maborosh/BandoriStation), the room number data collection platform of *Band Dream! Girls Band Party!* mobile game. Bandori Station only supports browser, which is oftentimes inconvenient for players to use, when they're in the mobile game participating activities. Therefore, this project is inspired.

*BandoriStation Mobile* is based on **Compose Multiplatform**, with a MVI clean architecture, conforming to Material3 design style. It shares the same server with [BandoriStation](https://github.com/maborosh/BandoriStation).
